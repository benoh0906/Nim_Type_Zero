Gilbreath shuffle
- A way to shuffle decks that ensures that with a deck of 4 different suits, each 4 cards will always feature all suits.
- Since the suits in this game are instead the values 0, 1, 2, 3 in simple terms it means that in every game there were a total of four of each number, redistributed randomly.
